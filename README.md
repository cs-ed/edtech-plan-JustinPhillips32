# Educational Technology Plan

This plan will be used to facilitate learning in a middle school computer science introduction class.

## Context

### Course
This educational technology plan will be for an Introduction to Computer Science class intended for middle school students (6th-8th). The purpose of this class would be to provide the basics for students who are interested in getting deeper into computer science in high school.


### Situation

The schedule for middle school students at my school (Pacific Union) doesn't allow for a full-time computer science course, so it would have to be offered as an "enrichment" option. Students would take the course twice a week for six weeks--12 total sessions. All of our students have their own Chromebooks so software decisions will be dependent upon what works for the Chrome operating system. We have a limited number of Verizon hotspots that could hopefully ensure every student has home internet connection. The students in our special day classes are integrated into the junior high curriculum at varying degrees, so it would be important to have video tutorials available so that these students could get one-on-one assistance outside of the twice-per-week meeting times.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

The students use ChromeOS. Instructors use MacOS. Scratch. Padlet for anonymous discussion/polling, iMovie for creating instructional videos to review outside of class, Google Classroom for grades, submitting assignments. Google Docs

### Hardware Specifications

Instructor laptop:
Macbook Air
1.2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
16 GB memory
250.69 HD storage

Student laptop:
 Chromebook
 1.1 GHz Celeron N3450
 32 GB Hard Drive
 4 GB Ram
 IDLE (free Python editor)
 
 Wifi, Verizon hotspots, TV monitor (for airplay), mircrophone, 
 
 


### Application

  As this lesson plan is meant for a twice-per-week enrichment class, there won't be any homework of any kind. All lessons would take place in-person. This class would focus on the importance of password security, the importance of inclusivity in regards to internet access, the difference between hardware and software and what they do, and scratch assignments to introduce students to the thought process behind coding. At the end of the six-week period, I would introduce students to basic Python coding using their default editor, IDLE. The purpose of this class would be to provide a basic understanding of computer science topics and give students an idea of what computer science and coding classes would be like in high school and beyond. 
(Teaching Standard for my reference)
(6-8.NI.6)- Encryption/Password Security. Lecture using Macbook and airplay to discuss modern internet security (passwords, encryption, 2FA, click all images that include a stoplight, etc) and its importance. Use historical examples of secret codes. Pair students up and challenge them to create their own encypted messages. The challenge would be to use any means necessary to send a message to their partner via e-mail that only the partner can decode. Coded message would be sent to all class members to see if they can "crack the code". Students would only need their Chromebook and access to school email. 
 
(6-8.AP.10)- Using flowcharts/pseudocode. Have students create flowcharts to build a framework for making computer code. I would have the students create a flowchart in Google Docs for something simple like a number guessing game. This would help conceptualize basic coding framework and how if/then statements work. 

(6-8.AP.17) Systematically test and refine programs. Have students use Scratch to learn how changing variables affects how quickly a sprite moves and in which direction. 
   I could provide a maze that stops sprite movement when touched and students would have to refine their sprite movements to move through increasingly narrower passages. The maze design would require students to reduce the distance covered by a single arrow click and change the sprite size. I would build the code for movement together with the class and share it with the students so that they all worked from the same starting point. I like the idea of setting this up as a race to the end of the maze with a second sprite at the end that was sound activated when touched. 

(6-8.AP.11) Creating variables. Have students create a Pong-style game that saves "my score" and "high score" as two separate variables. 

(6-8.IC.20) How computing technologies affect people's everyday lives and career options. Students would collaborate to build a website either in support of or against having wifi as a free public utility. I envision this project being the culmination of a two-week (4 meeting) lesson. Day 1 could be compiling a list of tasks that can be carried out efficiently with internet access and the time it can save you (for example, paying rent online vs. cashier's check in person or buying a plane ticket on a smartphone vs. driving to use library internet access). Day 2 could cover COVID and educational access on both sides of the digital divide. Day 3 would be a research day/gather information in order to build the website on day 4. 

Use IDLE (Python) as an IDE to do some basic, introductory coding at the end of the six-week unit. I would have students build a simple number guessing game so that they could work with if-then statements that they would have familiarity with from the Scratch problets. This would be intended to give students a glimpse of what coding looks like and to provide a fun challenge. Students would be better informed about what went into real coding after this exercise so that they could decide whether or not computer coding and/or computer science would be something they would want to pursue in high school and beyond.



### Impacts

All students will be able to learn because I will be providing equal access and opoprtunity to each of them, as well as supports for those who need it. All of my lessons will take place in person so no student's learning will have to suffer as a result of a lack of internet access at home. Outside of scratch and an IDE, students would be working with hardware and software that they should be comfortable with: their Chromebooks, email, Google docs. This educational plan is resilient because all of it can be completed virtually with Zoom if need be. I don't foresee any of my plans having any social/legal/ethical challenges. I intentionally left out an idea for a lesson plan because of potential social/ethical backlash (access to information online as it relates to national security).
